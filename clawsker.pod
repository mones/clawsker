=head1 NAME

Clawsker - A Claws Mail Tweaker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

clawsker [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clawsker is an applet to edit the so called Claws Mail hidden preferences.

Claws Mail is a fast, lightweight and feature-rich MUA with a high number 
of configurable options. To keep the binary small and fast some of these 
preferences which are not widely used are not provided with a graphical
interface for inspection and/or modification.

Users wanting to edit such preferences had to face raw editing of their 
configuration files, now you can do it with a convenient GTK2 interface
using Clawsker.

In adition to hidden features Clawsker can edit also some other settings
which usually can only be set indirectly. These include currently the
saved positions (and sizes when available) of Claws Mail windows.

=head1 OPTIONS

--help
	Shows a brief help screen.

--version
	Show information about program, Claws Mail and Perl-GTK versions.

--verbose
	Tells more on the standard output.

--alternate-config-dir <dir>
	Uses <dir> as Claws Mail configuration dir.

--clawsrc <file>
	Uses <file> as Claws Mail resource configuration file. This sets
	the full file name overriding any previous setting.

Multiple options are allowed, although only the last one has effect. Weird
option specifications may produce weird results (but otherwise correct).
	
=head1 LIMITATIONS

A running Claws Mail cannot be detected if using the --clawsrc option because
the directory is not assumed to be a Claws Mail configuration dir. If that is 
the case use the --alternate-config-dir option instead.
