Translating Clawsker - A Claws Mail Tweaker
-------------------------------------------

If you want to contribute a translation or update send it directly to
me: ricardo@mones.org

If you have questions or just want to get in touch with other
translators of the project you can subscribe to the Claws Mail
translators' mailing list:

http://lists.claws-mail.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/translators

Calls for translation updates before a new release are also sent to
this list.

New translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new translation just change to 'po' directory, copy the
'clawsker.pot' file into 'xx.po' or 'xx_YY.po', and fill the empty
strings and placeholder values (strings in CAPS). See how is done
in other translations for example.

The pot file can be obtained from a git clone or a release tarball.
The pot file in git it's only updated when a new release is near,
therefore, you may need to update it manually to get all the
translatable strings. Use 'make update-pot' for updating it before
copying to your language po file.

The 'xx' is your language code (e.g.: 'en' for English, 'fr' for
French, etc.) and, optionally, 'YY' defines your country variant
(e.g.: 'de_CH' for German variant in Switzerland).

Country should be used only if your translation is really specific to
that location, otherwise, and specially for new languages, try use the
generic language (you can always submit a specific one later).

Updating existing translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update an existing translation just type 'make xx.pox' or 'make
xx_YY.pox' to merge changes in pot file.

Update the new .pox file created and copy the .pox file into
the .po file.

If you intend to update a translation made by other and it has been
recently updated it's probably a good idea to contact first with last
translator.

Testing a translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once finished the new translation or the update you should test your
translation.

New translations need adding your 'xx' or 'xx_YY' code to the LINGUAS
variable in Makefile. Existing translation already have it.

Then type 'make'. A new .mo file with the same name of your .po file
should be created if everything is right.

Translations not maintained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a translation is not updated for several releases and the number of
translated strings drops below certain level it will be moved to the
directory 'po/unmaint'. Check there before making a new translation.

These translations will be also included in release tarballs but won't
be built or installed.
