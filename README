Clawsker - A Claws Mail Tweaker
-------------------------------

Clawsker is a Perl-GTK2 applet to edit hidden preferences for Claws Mail,
and to do it in a safe and user friendly way, preventing users from raw
editing of configuration files.

Claws Mail is a fast and lightweight Mail User Agent by the Claws Mail Team.

You can download the latest version from Clawsker homepage:

  http://www.claws-mail.org/clawsker.php

Dependencies
------------

  - Building:

  Nothing special: make, sed, install, gettext and pod2man.

  On Debian systems and derivatives:
  # apt-get install make sed coreutils gettext perl
  (Although you probably already have some of these installed)

  - Running:

  Perl - http://www.perl.com (>= 5.10)
  GTK+2 bindings for Perl - http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net (>= 1.161) built
  with GTK+ >= 2.12 (lower GTK+ versions do not support widget tooltips and
  a warning is issued).
  Locale::gettext - http://search.cpan.org/~pvandry/gettext-1.05/ (>= 1.05)
  Claws Mail - http://www.claws-mail.org (>= 3.9.1)

  On Debian systems:
  # apt-get install libgtk2-perl liblocale-gettext-perl claws-mail

Install
-------

After downloading the tarball:

  tar xJf clawsker-VERSION.tar.xz
  cd clawsker-VERSION
  make

If finished correctly, become root and:

  make install

Replace VERSION with the actual version number of the tarball.

Default install is under /usr/local prefix. If you want to install in another
location (for example /usr) replace last line with:

  make install PREFIX=/usr

Optionally you can provide also a DESTDIR as a root tree for the installation.
