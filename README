Clawsker - A Claws Mail Tweaker
-------------------------------

Clawsker is a Perl-GTK2 applet to edit hidden preferences for Claws Mail,
and to do it in a safe and user friendly way, preventing users from raw 
editing of configuration files.

Claws Mail is a fast and lightweight Mail User Agent by the Claws Mail Team.

You can download the latest version from Clawsker homepage:

  http://www.claws-mail.org/clawsker.php

Dependencies
------------

  - Building:

  Nothing special: make, sed, install, gettext and pod2man.

  On Debian systems:
  # apt-get install make sed coreutils gettext perl
  (Although you probably already have some of these installed)

  - Running:

  Perl - http://www.perl.com (>= 5.8)
  GTK+2 bindings for Perl - http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net (>= 1.161) built
  with GTK+ >= 2.12 (lower GTK+ versions do not support widget tooltips and 
  a warning is issued).
  Locale::gettext - http://search.cpan.org/~pvandry/gettext-1.05/ (>= 1.05)
  Claws Mail - http://www.claws-mail.org (>= 3.1.0)

  On Debian systems:
  # apt-get install libgtk2-perl liblocale-gettext-perl claws-mail

Install
-------

After downloading the tarball:

  tar xzf clawsker-VERSION.tar.gz
  cd clawsker-VERSION
  make

If finished correctly, become root and:

  make install

Replace VERSION with the actual version number of the tarball.

Default install is under /usr/local prefix. If you want to install in another
location (for example /usr) replace last line with:

  make install PREFIX=/usr

Optionally you can provide also a DESTDIR as a root tree for the installation.

Contributing
------------

Patches, bug fixes, and specially, new translations (or updates to the 
existing ones) are welcome. Development uses git as VCS and takes place on
http://github.com/mones/clawsker/.

If a Feature is new and supported by Claws-Mail version xyz or not supported anymore, update the corresponding array accordingly.
See "dot_lines" in clawsker as an example.


To create a new translation just change to 'po' directory, copy 'clawsker.pot'
into 'xx.po' or 'xx_YY.po',  and fill the empty strings and placeholder values. 
The 'xx' is your language code (e.g.: 'en' for English, 'fr' for French, etc.)
and, optionally, 'YY' defines your country variant (e.g.: 'de_CH' for German
variant in Switzerland). Country should be used only if your translation is
really specific to that location, otherwise, and specially for new languages,
try use the generic language (you can always submit a specific one later).

Once finished you can test your new translation by adding your 'xx' or 'xx_YY'
code to the LINGUAS variable in Makefile and running make. A new .mo file
with the same name of your .po file should be created if everything is right.

To update an existing translation just type 'make xx.pox' or 'make xx_YY.pox'
and update the new .pox file created, copy the .pox file to the .po file and
test it as above (no need to modify the Makefile this time).

Bugs
----

You can send bug reports on http://github.com/mones/clawsker/issues/ list.
Also directly by mail to me or in the Claws Mail mailing list, but the Issues
list is the preferred way.
